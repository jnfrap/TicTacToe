# TicTacToe

A simple TicTactToe game I did in a few days using Angular 16.

## How to launch

Run `git clone https://github.com/jnfrap/TicTacToe.git` to clone the repository.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
