# TicTacToe

A simple TicTacToe game I did in a few days using Angular 16. You can test it [here](http://51.77.214.235/tictactoe/).

## How to launch

Run `git clone https://github.com/jnfrap/TicTacToe.git` to clone the repository.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
